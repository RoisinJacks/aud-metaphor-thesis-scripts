Requirements
Workflow requires Python 3.9+, pip, and (ideally) a virtual environment. The scripts assum you can read/write .xlsx files locally. Placeholders “PATH/TO/…” must be replaced to point to your own files. Many scripts also assume inputs produced by earlier steps in the pipeline (e/g/ scraped data, Excel workbooks containing sampled sheets, tag-mapping outputs, etc.)
